This is a simple blog website built using Node.js, Express.js, and EJS. It allows users to compose blog posts and view them on the homepage. The project demonstrates core web development concepts such as routing, templating, and handling POST requests. All posts are stored temporarily in an in-memory array (no database integration yet).
